This reference is significant in that it seeks to highlight how this particular character (Sir Philip) is so prideful as to cloud his good judgment (sense). Over the course of the novel the reader observes how this foible is sustained in his efforts to court Belinda at the expense of Clarence's clear feelings for her and her own lack of response to his suit.","This excerpt can be found in Epistle 2, lines 283-296--or page 37-38 in the document.",Poetry,

Much of Hervey's appeal within the novel is situated in his easy capacity to match wits with Lady Delacour, but even more so in that his riffs have their locus in their intellectual and good-natured profundity. Ultimately the novel posits a morality/sensibility less concerned with the vanity considered inherent in this kind of social performance, but he is lauded for the sheer scope of his intellect all the same.","This excerpt can be found in book 14, lines 251-252--page 104 of volume 4.",Epic,

While this can easily be read as Lady Delacour advising Belinda ""not to let her real feelings show"" (464), an additional reading may be that a great deal of Lady Delacour's character construction has its basis in a self-imposed need to wittily perform in order to maintain her reputation and thrive within her social circumstances. Much of her reformation as a character is her removal from this somewhat vain fixation to a focus on cultivating a greater, more sincere amity with her husband and daughter.","This excerpt is from Act IV of this play, and can be found on page 55.",Play,

There are many points of significance in this juxtaposition, not the least of which aligning personal morality with serving God; in some ways, suggesting that the very highest order of conduct is reaching toward the highest order of being. There is also the more surface level consideration that vanity is being portrayed as a vice, and one which may lead to personal ruin or dissolution if left unchecked for a lifetime. What is of particular note in a second reading of the text as well is the part about being left vulnerable to enemies, in that Mrs. Freke rather cruelly capitalizes on this weakness within Lady Delacour (and within other characters as well).","This excerpt is from Act 3, scene two of this play, which can be found on page 65 of this document.

Unlike Delaval's unfortunate portend of his own life's end two days later, Lady Delacour is afforded the chance to change and live in a fulfilling way--which is a testament to what might be lost in the somewhat wooden and didactic morality within the text; ultimately this is a story in which people can achieve the same, so long as they understand their own potential and overcome their vices.",Lady Delacour's lament is mirrored in an account of Delaval's remarks to her Edgeworth's father on pages 155-156.,Memoir/Biography,

This, in line with Lady Delacour's thematic vanity--especially relied upon in strenuous moments--may be seen as an extension of that facet of her character. There is however an even more noticeable alignment beyond this direct mirroring, in that the beginning of the letter begins with the writer's lament of her own fixation with being a coquette, and the time she wasted in trying to emulate this self-same vanity--exactly like Lady Delacour's regret a handful of pages before: ""What a picture you have sent me of coquetry; it will cure me of all pretensions to it! I shall never again boast of being a coquette, and I shall all my life repent ever having had the appearance of one!

By contrast, Lady Delacour's finery in terms of her garments as well as her known tendency to wear a great deal of make-up is consistently remarked upon within the text--likely another statement on the inherent vice of that kind of excessive vanity.

This operates on two levels: the first, and perhaps most surface level reading, is to acknowledge that it is part of the mystique that she endeavors to cultivate as a coquette. The second, is that in her vanity to maintain appearances in some ways she does cease to be a person and becomes instead something of stand-in for the 'reformed rake' stock type.

39,,,Julius Caesar,William Shakespeare,1711,1711,38,"""'But I was going on to tell you that my good uncle, and all my relations, quarrelled with me for having ruined myself, as they said--but I said, they quarrelled with me for fear I should ask them for some of their 'vile trash'.'""",https://bc.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/01BC_INST/1nm9l4s/alma99123623370001021,"Likely with reference to Brutus' lines: ""I can raise no money by vile means / By heaven, I had rather coin my heart / And drop my blood for drachmas than to wring / From the hard hands of peasants their vile trash / By any indirection."" Particularly interesting in that here Brutus is lambasting Cassius for the money owed to him--and in some ways may be a reflection of Lady Delacour's displeasure with her husband and his lawyer's spending her fortune without caution. However, the end of the scene features a kind of reconiliation between the two and an acknowledgement of faults made, so this may be foreshadowing their martial recovery.","This is an excerpt from Act 4 Scene 3. The earliest edition by which I could find the lines referenced from Brutus was 1766, all editions prior do not have a clearly delineated scene 3 or appear to contain these spoken lines.",Play,
40,,,Thoughts on the Education of Daughters,Mary Wollstonecraft,1787,1787,39,"""'My second child was a girl, but a poor, diminutive, sickly thing.--It was the fashion at this time for fine mothers to suckle their own children--so much the worse for the poor brats.--Fine nurses never made fine children.'""",https://bc.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/01BC_INST/1nm9l4s/alma99115229580001021,"Wollstonecraft early on in this text advocates for a closer bond between mother and child in child-rearing, particularly with regard to breast-feeding infants instead of handing them off to wet-nurses: ""The mother (if there are not very weighty reasons to prevent her) ought to suckle her children"". Lady Delacour shows some contempt for this practice, but there is reason to believe that it has more to do with unresolved grief with the death of her first child than necessarily an oppositional alignment with Wollstonecraft. Her inability to socially engage with other women on this level and enjoy what was considered the height of domestic happiness (in Edgeworth's view, the nuclear family unit especially) was likely highlighted here.","Pages 3-4 detail Wollstonecraft's commitment to the practice as mentioned in the passage. Of particular note is the fact that modern science has confirmed the veracity of improved health and bonding through this practice, and its contribution to preventing disease or harm from neglect.",,
41,,,Olney Hymns,William Cowper,1779,1779,40,"""'You see I had nothing at home, either in the shape of husband or children, to engage my affections. I believe it was this 'aching void' in my heart which made me, after looking abroad some time for a bosom friend, take such a prodigious fancy to Mrs. Freke.'""",https://bc.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/01BC_INST/1nm9l4s/alma99115902520001021,"Central to Lady Delacour's narrative function as a reforemd rake and Maria Edgeworth's larger literary aim of writing a moral tale, here she details the ways in which her lack of a developed home life with her husband and child resulted in her focus on vanity and social attention. A stanza in the hymn referenced includes the lines: ""What peaceful hours I once enjoy'd! / How sweet their mem'ry still! / But they have left an aching void, / The world can never fill.'"" Edgeworth may be further implying here that fulfillment cannot be achieved for a woman without the joys of a peaceful married life cultivated in virtue, and that this self-same void cannot be filled by any form of vice such as vanity or a reliance on alcohol as featured in Lord Delacour.","With reference to the first hymn featured in this collection, called: 'O! for a closer walk with God!', and can be found on page 4.",Hymn,
42,,,False Delicacy,Hugh Kelly,1768,1768,41,"""'I found it necessary to reform my manners. If I had not taken heart of grace, and publicly abjured the heresies of false delicacy, I should have been excommunicated--Lady Delacour's sprightly elegance--allow me to speak of myself in the style in which the newspaper writers talk of me.'""",https://bc.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/01BC_INST/1nm9l4s/alma99116302440001021,,Comic play,Play,
43,,,To a Lady',Alexander Pope,1735,1735,41,"""'[Mrs.Freke] had the talent of making the world believe that virtue to be invulnerable by nature, which disdained the common outworks of art for it's defence. I, amongst others, took it for granted, that the woman who could make it her sport to 'touch the brink of all we hate,' must have a stronger head than other people.""",https://bc.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/01BC_INST/1nm9l4s/alma99118085650001021,"A reference to Pope's description of Calypso: ""'Twas thus Calypso once our hearts alarm'd, / Aw'd without virtue, without Beauty charm'd / Her Tongue bewitch'd as oddly as her Eyes, / Less Wit than Mimic, more a Wit than Wife, / Strange Graces still, and stranger Flights she had, / Was just not ugly, and was just not mad; / Yet never so sure our passion to create, / As when she touch'd the brink of all we hate."" There are several points of intrigue here, each of which foreshadowing a great deal of Mrs. Freke's chracterization. From her erratic and haphazardous behavior, to the intentional way that she capitalizes upon the weakness of others. For example, how she uses Juba's superstitious nature against him as well as attempts to persuade Belinda against the virtue inherent in the Percivals' lifestyle--reducing it to boring worthlessness. Much of her ability to deceive Lady Delacour was in her deliberate manipulation of the former's vanity and desperation for social belonging. Calypso as a figure herself is also an evocative extrapolation, in that the name itself means to ""conceal,"" and the reader discovers just how much Mrs. Freke conceals from both Lady Delacour and others in general: her initial introduction into the text was the deliberate prank played on Hervey regarding who was dressed as the widow Brady. Furthermore, Mrs. Freke hides the way in which she leads Colonel Lawless to believe Lady Delacour wanted to separate from lord Delacour and be his lover instead, resulting in the calamitous duel for her honor. The particular line ""less wit than mimic"" is also rather powerful here, in that Mrs. Freke turns out to be unable to hold her own against Sir Percival in a debate about the inherent value of virtue, signalling the fact that she is more prone to copy fallacious, surface level arguments without a real substantive justification to add to the debate.",Lines 49-52,Correspondence,
44,,,The Vicar of Wakefield,Oliver Goldsmith,1766,1766,41,"""'The league of amity between [Lady Delacour and Mrs. Freke] was scarcely ratified, before my lord Delacour came with his wise remonstrating face, to beg me 'to consider what was due to my honor and his.'--Like the cosmogony-man in the Vicar of Wakefield, he came out over and over with this cant phrase, which had once stood him in stead.'""",https://bc.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/01BC_INST/1nm9l4s/alma99110887330001021,"With direct reference to Ephraim Jenkinson, who intentionally deceives his audience that he is a learned man via his repeated explication of cosmogony. While Lady Delacour speaks ill of Lord Delacour here, there is a contradictory element to this comparison; in that Lord Delacour turns out to be right about how negative an influence Mrs. Freke was on both of their honor as a result of entangling Colonel Lawless into their affairs.","2 vols, vol 1 ch.14 and vol 2 ch 4",Novel,

Pray you avoid it."" Here he is advising the player not to overdo his acting, and in much the same way Lady Delacour means to imply that Mrs. Freke took the mockery of her concerns to a whole new level.","This excerpt can be found in Act Three, scene two, and can be found on page 46.",Play,

Of interest here is the preface to this line, in that Lady Delacour's reformation is central to her character--and is something that she chooses for herself with the help of Belinda, in the aftermath of Mrs. Freke's betrayal and the exacerbation of her chest wound. Much of Lady Delcaour's dissolution is something that she perceives as inevitable too, although there are aspects of it that were exacerbated by both her and her husband's vices. Furthermore, here Cassius can be seen as taking on something of Mrs. Freke's aim, in that he tries to bolster Brutus as equal to Caesar, which is mirrored in Mrs. Freke's elevation of Lady Delacour leading to the death of another man.","This excerpt is from Act 1, scene 2, and can be found on page 10 of this document.",Play,
